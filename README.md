# KAnix + KASH
KAnix is a fully fledged operating system written in JavaScript made for use on the Khan Academy platform (hence the name, **K**han **A**cademy \***nix**). It has an operable filesystem that is similar in many ways to Unix's.

KASH is an extremely basic shell that comes with KAnix (hence the name, **K**han **A**cademy **SH**ell). As I said, it's extremely basic and nowhere near POSIX.
```
kash.pH = 1e3;
```

KAnix is currently at version v0.1.6, and KASH is currently at v0.8b.
In development is KAnix v0.1.7 + KASH v0.8c, which is a major release in and to itself, but will need much more improvement in v0.1.8 + v0.8d.

After that will come v0.1.9 + v0.9, the last release before the first ultra-stable release, v0.2.0 + v1.0.
