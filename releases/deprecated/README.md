# Deprecated README

This directory is for deprecated releases (i.e. non-backwards compatible, exploits KA glitch guardians don't like).

The files are sorted into folders by warning level:
1. Usable; though KASH version is no longer compatible
2. Usable; though KAnix framwork is no longer compatible
3. Usable; though for developer usage only GUI is down
4. Unusable; major flaw in framework or KASH
5. Punishable; Guardians said not to use it unless program is hidden for experimentation
